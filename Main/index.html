            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                With a degree in English from Guangdong University of Foreign Studies, where I also studied Spanish as a
                second language, I have a strong linguistic foundation. My education includes an exchange program at the
                National University of Singapore, further enhancing my global perspective.
            </p>
            <p>
                My expertise extends beyond the classroom. I have extensive experience working as a translator and
                interpreter in various industries, including foreign trade, factory visits, business negotiations, and
                international exhibitions. Having lived and worked with English and Spanish-speaking professionals, I
                have honed my communication skills for diverse cultural contexts. Additionally, my role as a retail
                anchor on TikTok in the US market showcases my fluency in English.
